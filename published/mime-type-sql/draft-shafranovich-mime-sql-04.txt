Internet-Draft       The application/sql Media Type        February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Structured Query Language (SQL) has been in use for over 30 years
   with various types of database technologies.  However, there is no
   current media type registered for SQL.  Therefore, this document
   seeks to formally register the application/sql media type to be used
   for SQL with IANA.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when they
   appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear in this document in
   lower case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.


3.  Media Type Registration Application

   This section provides the media type registration application for
   this media type (see [RFC6838], Section 5.6)

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: sql

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters:

      "charset" - indicates the character set to be used.  When not
      specified, a default value MUST NOT be assumed.

      Implementators should be aware that SQL may carry character set
      information in-band.  In such cases, the "charset" parameter
      SHOULD NOT be used.  In cases, where no character information is
      supplied in-band, implementors SHOULD use the "charset" parameter,
      if possible.

   Encoding considerations:

      If the "charset" parameter is used, the corresponding 7-bit, 8-bit
      or binary encoding may be used.  If the "charset" parameter is not
      used, binary encoding may be required.

   Security considerations:

      Being that SQL is a full fledged programming language and may
      include embedded source code for other programming languages, it
      may be used to transfer malware, viruses and other malicious
      payloads.  Implementors and users are encouraged only to exchange
      SQL files among trusted parties and utilize all available security
      measures such as restricted access, virus scanners, etc. to
      minimize risk.

      Implementors should also be aware that guessing character sets,
      encodings, and possible conflicts between in-band and out-of-band
      character set information may lead to the similar security issues
      as described above.

   Interoperability considerations:

      While a single standard exists ([ISO.9075.2011]), vendor
      implementations of the standard vary significantly.  Implementors
      and users should make sure that the exchanged SQL files match to
      the specific database/tool and version that they are using.

   Published specification:

      The most recent specification of SQL is available in
      [ISO.9075.2011].

   Applications that use this media type:

      Databases and related tools

   Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

      Magic number(s): N/A

      File extension(s): sql

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): N/A

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

      Yakov Shafranovich <ietf@shaftek.org>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: N/A

   Author: IESG

   Change controller: IESG

   Provisional registration? (standards tree only): N/A


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the media type application/sql in the
   Standards tree using the application provided in Section 3 of this
   document.


5.  Security Considerations

   See the Security Considerations item in the registration template in
   Section 3, above.
