Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem has grown in the past few years, network
   operators have begun to exchange abuse reports among themselves and
   other parties to combat this problem.  However, different operators
   define their own formats and the receivers are forced to write custom
   software to interpret the many types of them.  In addition, many
   operators use various other report formats to provide non-abuse
   feedback about processed email.  This memo seeks to define a standard
   extensible format and the "message/feedback-report" MIME type for
   these reports in accordance with RFC 2048 [11].  This format and
   content type is intended to be used within the scope of the framework
   of the "multipart/report" content type defined in RFC 3462 [1].
   While there have been previous work in this area([12] and [13]), none
   of them have yet been sucessful.  It is hoped that this document will
   have a better fate.

   This format is intended primarily as an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)
   for reporting email abuse but also includes support for feedback
   loops, virus reports and other similar activities.

   This document only defines the format and content type to be used for
   these reports.  Determination of where these reports should be sent,
   how trust among report senders and receivers is established, and
   reports related to more than one message are outside the scope of
   this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

   NOTE: This document may be incomplete and is intented to evolve based
   on public discussion and feedback.  Readers are encourages to submit
   their comments and suggestions.

2.  Intent

   The reports defined in this document are intended for several
   purposes:

   o  To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from or related to
      their networks

   o  To provide feedback about abuse complaints to email service
      providers and relevant third parties (such as reputation
      providers)

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


   o  To inform email service provides about opt-out requests

   Please note that while the parent "multipart/report" content type
   defined in RFC 3462 [1] is used for all kinds of administrative
   messages, this format is intended specifically for communications
   among providers regarding email abuse and related issues, and SHOULD
   NOT be used for other reports.

3.  Requirements

   The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports (the
   actual standard is defined in the next sections) :

   o  They must be both human and machine readable

   o  A copy of the original email message (body and headers) or the
      message headers must be enclosed in order to allow the receiver to
      properly handle the report.

   o  The machine readable section must provide ability for the report
      generators to share metadata with receivers,

   o  The format must be extensible.


4.  Format of Email Feedback Reports

   To satisfy the requirements, an email feedback report is defined as a
   MIME message with a top level MIME content type of "multipart/report"
   (as defined in RFC 3462 [1]).  The following apply:

   a.  The "report-type" parameter of "multipart/report" type is set to
       "feedback-report"

   b.  The first MIME part of the message contains a human readable
       description of the report and MUST be included.

   c.  The second MIME part of the message is a machine-readable section
       with the content type of "message/feedback-report" (defined later
       on in this document) and MUST be included.  This section is
       intended to convey metadata about the report in question that may
       not be readily available from the included email message itself.

   d.  The third MIME part of the message contains either a full copy of
       the original message with a MIME content type of "message/rfc822"
       (as defined in RFC 2046 [3]) OR a copy of the headers from the
       original message with MIME content type of "text/rfc822-headers"
       (as defined in RFC 3462 [1]).  This part MUST BE included (unlike

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


       RFC 3462 [1]).  While some operators may choose to modify or
       munge this portion for privacy or legal reasons, it is
       RECOMMENDED that the entire original email message be included
       without any modification.

   e.  Each feedback report MUST be related to only a SINGLE email
       message.  Summary and aggregate formats are outside the scope of
       this specification.

   f.  The subject line of the feedback report SHOULD be the same as the
       included email message and MAY include only the standard
       forwarding prefix used by MUAs such as "FW:" (many smaller
       operators using MUAs for abuse handling rely on the subject lines
       for processing).


5.  Format of 'message/feedback-report' Content Type

   This content type provides a machine-readable section intended to let
   the report generator convey metadata to the report receiver.  The
   intent of this section is it allow report generators to convey
   metadata to report receivers that may not available or may not be
   readily available from the originating email message or headers.

   The body of this content type consists of multiple "fields" formatted
   according to the ABNF of RFC 822 [14] header "fields".  This section
   defines the initial set of fields provided by this specification.
   Additional fields maybe registered according to the procedure
   described later on in this document.  Note that these fields
   represent information that the receiver is asserting about the report
   in question, but are not necessarily verifiable.  Report receivers
   MUST NOT assume that these assertions are always true.

5.1  Required Fields

   The following header fields are REQUIRED and MUST only appear once:

   o  "Feedback-Type:" - contains the type of feedback report (as
      defined in the corresponding IANA registry).  This is intended to
      let report generators distinguish among different types of
      reports.

   o  "User-Agent:" - indicates the name and version of the software
      program that generated the report.  The format of this field MUST
      follow section 14.43 of RFC 2616 [4].

   o  "Version" - indicates the version of specification that the report
      generator is using to generate the report.  The version number in

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


      this specification is set to "0.1".


5.2  Optional Fields Appearing Once

   The following header fields are OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear more
   than once:

   o  "Original-Mail-From:" - copy of the email address used in the MAIL
      FROM portion of the original SMTP transaction.  The format of this
      field is defined in section 4.1.1.2 of RFC 2821 [5].

   o  "Original-Rcpt-To:" - copy of the email address used in the RCPT
      TO portion of the original SMTP transaction.  The format of this
      field is defined in section 4.1.1.3 of RFC 2821 [5].

   o  "Received-Date:" - indicates the date the original message was
      received by the report generator.  This field MUST BE formatted as
      per section 3.3 of RFC 2822 [6].

   o  "Source-IP:" - contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from
      which the original message was received.  IPv4 addresses are to be
      formatted in dot-decimal notation as currently used by the
      community.  IPv6 addresses MUST BE formatted as per section 2.2 of
      RFC 2373 [7].


5.3  Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times

   The following set of header fields are OPTIONAL and MAY appear more
   than once:

   o  "Authentication-Results:" - indicates the result of an
      authentication check run by the report generator.  The format of
      this field is is defined in draft-kucherawy-sender-auth-header
      [8].  Report receivers should note that this field only indicates
      an assertion made by the report generator.

   o  "Reported-Domain:" - indicates a domain name that the report
      generator believes to be relevant to the report.  Domain format is
      defined in section 2.3.1 of RFC 1035 [9].

   o  "Reported-URI:" - indicates a URI that the report generator
      believes to be relevant to the report.  URI format is defined in
      RFC 2396 [15].

   o  "Removal-Recipient:" - indicates the email address to be removed
      from the mailing list (MUST only be used with  "opt-out" and "opt-

      out-list" types).  The format of this field is defined in section
      3.4.1 of RFC 2822 [6].


6.  MIME Type Registration of message/feedback-report

   This section provides the media type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [11], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media types message/feedback-report

   MIME media type name: message

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller: IESG

7.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended overtime to fit the ever changing landscape of the Internet.
   Therefore, extensibility is being provided via two IANA registries:
   one for feedback types and a second for header fields.  The feedback
   type registry is to be used in conjunction with the "Feedback-Type"
   field above.  The header name registry is intended for registration
   of new metadata fields to be used in the machine readable portion
   (part 2) of this format.  Please note that version numbers do not
   change with new field registrations unless a new specification of
   this format is published.  Also note that all new field registrations
   can only registered OPTIONAL fields.  Any new required fields REQUIRE
   a new version of this specification to be published.

   In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability of this
   format, implementors SHOULD ignore any fields they do not support.

8.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register MIME type "message/
   feedback-report" using the application provided in this document and
   setup two registries: one for header field names and a second for
   "Feedback-Type" values.  This section contains the templates used for
   registration of new entries in these registries and initial values.
   New registrations to these two registries MUST have approval by an
   Designated Expert in accordance with the Expert Review guidelines as
   described in RFC 2434 [10] (the expert should be appointed by the
   Area Directors of the Applications Area).  Any new field registered
   is considered OPTIONAL unless a new version of this specification is
   published.

   For the header name registry, the following MUST be provided in an
   RFC publication (or Internet draft with IETF consensus or IESG
   approval) in order to register a new header field name:

   1.  Name of the field being registered

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  Which "Feedback-Type" types does this field apply to (or "any")

   5.  The RFC number (or Internet draft name) in which this header is
       registered

   If the header field being registered requires its own IANA registry,
   than the appropriate registry MUST be properly defined.

   For the feedback type registry, the following MUST be provided in an
   RFC publication (or Internet draft with IETF consensus or IESG
   approval) in order to register a new header field name:

   1.  Name of the feedback type being registered

   2.  Short description

   3.  The RFC number (or Internet draft name) in which this feedback
       type is registered

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


   o  Clarified the main format section to make all three parts
      mandatory

   o  Changed section 4f regarding subject lines to mandate that subject
      lines should be left intact.  Removed the convention for subject
      lines that was defined in the previous version

   o  Added text to the the machine readable section clarifying its
      intent.  Also added RFC 2119 references, reorganized fields,
      indicated whether specific header fields can appear more than once
      and provided references as to how they should be formatted.

   o  Removed "Original-Message-ID", "Authenticated-Domain:" and
      "Authenticated-Domain-Method" from the draft including related
      IANA registries.  Added "Version", "User-Agent", Original-Mail-
      From", "Original-Rcpt-To", "Reported-Uri", "Reported-Domain" and
      "Authentication-Results".

   o  Minor spelling corrections

   o  Added authentication headers and registry

   o  Added feedback-type header and registry.


B.4  Outstanding Issues

   Here is a list of some outstanding issues for this document that have
   not been finalized:

   o  Whether encoding of the machine readable part should be limited to
      7-bit

   o  Whether there is a need for both "opt-out" and "opt-out-list", and
      whether this format should be used for opt-outs at all.

   o  Whether the "from" address should be required to be a human just
      like other RFCs in the "message/report" family.

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2005


   o  Whether there is a need for a new header to indicate munging of
      the included email message.

   o  Whether different type of convention should be allowed for subject
      lines.

   o  Whether there should be different types defined for "Reported-Uri"
      to better indicate to the report receiver how they are related to
      the email message in question.
