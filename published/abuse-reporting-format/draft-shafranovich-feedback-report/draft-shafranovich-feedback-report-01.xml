	<abstract>
		<t>This document defines an extensible format and MIME type that may be used by network operators to report
		feedback about received email to other parties. This format is intended as a machine readable replacement for various existing report formats currently used in Internet email.</t>
	</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
	<t>As the spam problem has grown in the past few years, network operators have begun to exchange abuse reports
	among themselves and other parties to combat this problem. However, different operators define their own formats
	and the receivers are forced to write custom software to interpret the many types of them. In addition, many operators use various other report formats to provide non-abuse feedback about processed email. This memo seeks to define a standard extensible format and the "message/feedback-report" MIME type for these reports in accordance with <xref target="RFC2048">RFC 2048</xref>. This format and content type is intended to be used within the scope of the framework of the "multipart/report" content type defined in <xref target="RFC3462">RFC 3462</xref>. While there have been previous work in this area(<xref target="STRADS_BCP"/> and <xref target="ASRG_ABUSE"/>), none of them have yet been sucessful. It is hoped that this document will have a better fate.
	</t>
	
	<t>This format is intended primarily as an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) for reporting email abuse but also includes support for feedback loops, virus reports and other similar activities.</t>

	<t>This document only defines the format and content type to be used for these reports. Determination of where
	these reports should be sent, how trust among report senders and receivers is established, and reports related to more than one message are outside the scope of this document.
	</t>
	
	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
	</t>
	
	<t>NOTE: This document may be incomplete and is intented to evolve based on public discussion and feedback. Readers are encourages to submit their comments and suggestions.</t>
</section>

<section title="Intent">
	<t>The reports defined in this document are intended for several purposes:
	<list style="symbols">	
		<t>To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from or related to their networks</t>
		<t>To provide feedback about abuse complaints to email service providers and relevant third parties (such as reputation providers)</t>
		<t>To inform email service provides about opt-out requests</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>Please note that while the parent "multipart/report" content type defined in <xref target="RFC3462">RFC 3462</xref> is used for all kinds of administrative messages, this format is intended specifically for communications among providers regarding email abuse and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be used for other reports.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Requirements">
	<t>The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports (the actual standard is defined in the next sections) :
	<list style="symbols">	
		<t>They must be both human and machine readable</t>
		<t>A copy of the original email message (body and headers) or the message headers must be enclosed in order to allow the receiver to properly handle the report.
		</t>
		<t>The machine readable section must provide ability for the report generators to share metadata with receivers,</t>
		<t>The format must be extensible.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Format of Email Feedback Reports">
	<t>To satisfy the requirements, an email feedback report is defined as a MIME message with a top level MIME content type of "multipart/report" (as defined in <xref target="RFC3462">RFC 3462</xref>). The following apply:
	<list style="letters">	
		<t>The "report-type" parameter of "multipart/report" type is set to "feedback-report"</t>
		<t>The first MIME part of the message contains a human readable description of the report and MUST be included.</t>
		<t>The second MIME part of the message is a machine-readable section with the content type
		of "message/feedback-report" (defined later on in this document) and MUST be included. This section is intended to convey metadata about the report in question that may not be readily available from the included email message itself.
		</t>
		<t>The third MIME part of the message contains either a full copy of the original message with a MIME content type
		of "message/rfc822" (as defined in <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref>) OR a copy of
		the headers from the original message with MIME content type of "text/rfc822-headers"
		(as defined in <xref target="RFC3462">RFC 3462</xref>). This part MUST BE included (unlike <xref target="RFC3462">RFC 3462</xref>). While some operators may choose to modify or munge this portion for privacy or legal reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the entire original email message be included without any modification.
		</t>
		<t>Each feedback report MUST be related to only a SINGLE email message. Summary and aggregate formats are outside the scope of this specification.</t>
		<t>The subject line of the feedback report SHOULD be the same as the included email message and MAY include only the standard forwarding prefix used by MUAs such as "FW:" (many smaller operators using MUAs for abuse handling rely on the subject lines for processing).
		</t>
	</list>
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Format of 'message/feedback-report' Content Type">
	<t>This content type provides a machine-readable section intended to let the report generator convey metadata to the report receiver. The intent of this section is it allow report generators to convey metadata to report receivers that may not available or may not be readily available from the originating email message or headers.
	</t>
	<t> The body of this content type consists of multiple "fields" formatted according to the ABNF of <xref target="RFC0822">RFC 822</xref> header "fields". This section defines the initial set of fields provided by this specification. Additional fields maybe registered according to the procedure described later on in this document. Note that these fields represent information that the receiver is asserting about the report in question, but are not necessarily verifiable. Report receivers MUST NOT assume that these assertions are always true.
	</t>
	<section title="Required Fields">
	<t>The following header fields are REQUIRED and MUST only appear once:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>"Feedback-Type:" - contains the type of feedback report (as defined in the corresponding IANA registry). This is intended to let report generators distinguish among different types of reports.</t>
		<t>"User-Agent:" - indicates the name and version of the software program that generated the report. The format of this field MUST follow section 14.43 of <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Version" - indicates the version of specification that the report generator is using to generate the report. The version number in this specification is set to "0.1".</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Optional Fields Appearing Once">
	<t>The following header fields are OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear more than once:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>"Original-Mail-From:" - copy of the email address used in the MAIL FROM portion of the original SMTP transaction. The format of this field is defined in section 4.1.1.2 of <xref target="RFC2821">RFC 2821</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Original-Rcpt-To:" - copy of the email address used in the RCPT TO portion of the original SMTP transaction. The format of this field is defined in section 4.1.1.3 of <xref target="RFC2821">RFC 2821</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Received-Date:" - indicates the date the original message was received by the report generator. This field MUST BE formatted as per section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC2822">RFC 2822</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Source-IP:" - contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from which the original message was received. IPv4 addresses are to be formatted in dot-decimal notation as currently used by the community. IPv6 addresses MUST BE formatted as per section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC2373">RFC 2373</xref>.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times">
	<t>The following set of header fields are OPTIONAL and MAY appear more than once:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>"Authentication-Results:" - indicates the result of an authentication check run by the report generator. The format of this field is is defined in <xref target="I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header">draft-kucherawy-sender-auth-header</xref>. Report receivers should note that this field only indicates an assertion made by the report generator.</t>
		<t>"Reported-Domain:" - indicates a domain name that the report generator believes to be relevant to the report. Domain format is defined in section 2.3.1 of <xref target="RFC1035">RFC 1035</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Reported-URI:" - indicates a URI that the report generator believes to be relevant to the report. URI format is defined in <xref target="RFC2396">RFC 2396</xref>.</t>
		<t>"Removal-Recipient:" - indicates the email address to be removed from the mailing list (MUST only be used with  "opt-out" and "opt-out-list" types). The format of this field is defined in section 3.4.1 of <xref target="RFC2822">RFC 2822</xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Extensibility">
	<t>Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be extended overtime to fit the ever changing landscape of the Internet. Therefore, extensibility is being provided via two IANA registries: one for feedback types and a second for header fields. The feedback type registry is to be used in conjunction with the "Feedback-Type" field above. The header name registry is intended for registration of new metadata fields to be used in the machine readable portion (part 2) of this format. Please note that version numbers do not change with new field registrations unless a new specification of this format is published. Also note that all new field registrations can only registered OPTIONAL fields. Any new required fields REQUIRE a new version of this specification to be published.
	</t>
	<t>In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability of this format, implementors SHOULD ignore any fields they do not support.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
	<t>After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register MIME type "message/feedback-report"
	using the application provided in this document and setup two registries: one for header field names and a second for "Feedback-Type" values. This section contains the templates used for registration of new entries in these registries and initial values. New registrations to these two registries MUST have approval by an Designated Expert in accordance with the Expert Review guidelines as described in <xref target="RFC2434">RFC 2434</xref> (the expert should be appointed by the Area Directors of the Applications Area). Any new field registered is considered OPTIONAL unless a new version of this specification is published.</t>
	<t>For the header name registry, the following MUST be provided in an RFC publication (or Internet draft with IETF consensus or IESG approval) in order to register a new header field name:
	<list style="numbers">
		<t>Name of the field being registered</t>
		<t>Short description of the field</t>
		<t>Whether the field can appear more than once</t>
		<t>Which "Feedback-Type" types does this field apply to (or "any")</t>
		<t>The RFC number (or Internet draft name) in which this header is registered</t>
	</list>
	If the header field being registered requires its own IANA registry, than the appropriate registry MUST be properly defined.
	</t>
	<t>For the feedback type registry, the following MUST be provided in an RFC publication (or Internet draft with IETF consensus or IESG approval) in order to register a new header field name:
	<list style="numbers">
		<t>Name of the feedback type being registered</t>
		<t>Short description</t>

<abstract>
<t>
   Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and
   other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and
   deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a
   new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication
   algorithm for IPSec).  To insure that such quantities have consistent
   values and interpretations in different implementations, their
   assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF
   protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA).
</t>
<t>
   In order for the IANA to manage a given name space prudently, it
   needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can
   be assigned. If the IANA is expected to play a role in the management
   of a name space, the IANA must be given clear and concise
   instructions describing that role.  This document discusses issues
   that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning
   values to a name space and provides guidelines to document authors on
   the specific text that must be included in documents that place
   demands on the IANA.

<abstract>
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<abstract>
<t>STD 11, RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, but which leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>
<t>(1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,</t>
<t>(2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,</t>
<t>(3)   multi-part message bodies, and</t>
<t>(4)   textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.</t>
<t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11 and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.</t>
<t>The initial document in this set, RFC 2045, specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. This second document defines the general structure of the MIME media typing sytem and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related facilities.  The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME
   conformance criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
<t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>
   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters
   for identifying an abstract or physical resource.  This document
   defines the generic syntax of URI, including both absolute and
   relative forms, and guidelines for their use; it revises and replaces
   the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URI,
   such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI
   reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
   possible identifier type.  This document does not define a generative
   grammar for URI; that task will be performed by the individual
   specifications of each URI scheme.
</t></abstract>
<note title='IESG Note'>
<t>
   This paper describes a "superset" of operations that can be applied
   to URI.  It consists of both a grammar and a description of basic
   functionality for URI.  To understand what is a valid URI, both the
   grammar and the associated description have to be studied.  Some of
   the functionality described is not applicable to all URI schemes, and
   some operations are only possible when certain media types are
   retrieved using the URI, regardless of the scheme used.

<t>
   STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
   message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
   documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

<list>
<t>
    (1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than
          US-ASCII,
</t>
<t>
    (2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
          message bodies,
</t>
<t>
    (3)   multi-part message bodies, and
</t>
<t>
    (4)   textual header information in character sets other than
          US-ASCII.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
   11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
   so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.
   This fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration
   procedures for the following MIME facilities:

<list>
<t>
    (1)   media types,
</t>
<t>
    (2)   external body access types,
</t>
<t>
    (3)   content-transfer-encodings.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Registration of character sets for use in MIME is covered elsewhere
   and is no longer addressed by this document.
</t>
<t>
   These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves
   were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049
   describes differences and changes from previous versions.
