Internet-Draft       The application/sql Media Type        November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Structured Query Language (SQL) has been in use for over 30 years
   with various types of database technologies.  However, there is no
   current media type registered for SQL.  Therefore, this document
   seeks to formally register the application/sql media type to be used
   for SQL with IANA.


2.  Media Type Registration Application

   This section provides the media type registration application which
   will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of this document.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: sql

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations:

      While SQL uses US-ASCII by default, some implementations may use
      other encodings including [Unicode].

   Security considerations:

      Being that SQL is a full fledged programming language and may
      include embedded source code for other programming languages, it
      may be used to transfer malware, viruses and other malicious
      payloads.  Implementors and users are encouraged only to exchange
      SQL files among trusted parties and utilize all available security
      measures such as restricted access, virus scanners, etc. to
      minimize risk.

   Interoperability considerations:

      While a single standard exists ([ISO.9075.2011]), vendor
      implementations of the standard vary significantly.  Implementors
      and users should make sure that the exchanged SQL files match to
      the specific database/tool and version that they are using.

   Published specification:

      The most recent specification of SQL is available in
      [ISO.9075.2011].

Internet-Draft       The application/sql Media Type        November 2012


   Applications that use this media type:

      Databases and related tools

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): N/A

      File extension(s): sql

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

      Yakov Shafranovich <ietf@shaftek.org>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: N/A

   Author/Change controller: IESG


3.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register the MIME type
   application/sql using the application provided in Section 2 of this
   document.


4.  Security Considerations

   See discussion above


5.  Acknowledgments
