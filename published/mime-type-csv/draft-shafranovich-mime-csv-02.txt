Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV         February 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format, many of which vary from system to system.  This document
   seeks to document the format of comma separated values (CSV) files
   and to formally register the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV in
   accordance with RFC 2048 [4].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex.  [5], [6], [7] and [8]), no formal specification
   exists which causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   This section seeks to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and will usually contain the same number of fields as the records
       in the rest of the file.  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, delimited by commas.  The last field in the record may or
       may not be followed by a comma.  For example:



Shafranovich             Expires August 22, 2005                [Page 3]


       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF) and commas should be enclosed
       in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then double-quotes
       inside fields must be surrounded by double quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b"""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [1] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(VCHAR / CR / LF / CRLF / 3*DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *VCHAR

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [1]

      DQUOTE =  %x22;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [1]

      LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [1]

      CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [1]

      VCHAR = %x21-7E ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [1]

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [4], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1.  of RFC 2046 [2], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [3]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt
      at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this

      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller: IESG

4.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register the MIME type
   "text/csv" using the application provided in Section 3 of this
   document.

5.  Security Considerations

   See discussion above

6.  Acknowledgments
