1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for "text/tab-separated-
   values" type, no MIME types have ever been registered with IANA for
   CSV.  At the same time, various programs and operating systems have
   begun to use different MIME types for this format, many of which vary
   from system to system.  This document seeks to document the format of
   comma separated values (CSV) files and to formally register the "text
   /csv" MIME type for CSV in accordance with RFC 2048 [RFC2048].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex.  [CREATIVYST], [EDOCEO], [RICE] and [ART]), no
   formal specification exists which causes a wide variety of
   interpretations for CSV files.  This section seeks to document the
   format that seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV              May 2014


       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  The last field in the
       record may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double
       quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [RFC2234] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV              May 2014


      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [RFC2234]

      DQUOTE = %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [RFC2234]

      LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [RFC2234]

      CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [RFC2234]

      TEXTDATA = %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [RFC2048], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG
   approval of this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjuction with
      the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementators choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [RFC2046], this media type uses
      CRLF to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware
      that some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [RFC0793]) when processing CSV files.  An
      attempt at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT
