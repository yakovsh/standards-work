Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions
   evolve, network operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports
   among themselves and other parties.  However, different operators
   have defined their own formats, and thus the receivers of these
   reports are forced to write custom software to interpret each.  In
   addition, many operators use various other report formats to provide
   non-abuse-related feedback about processed email.  This memo seeks to
   define a standard extensible format and the "message/feedback-report"
   MIME type for these reports in accordance with RFC 2048 [RFC2048].
   This format and content type is intended to be used within the scope
   of the framework of the "multipart/report" content type defined in
   RFC 3462 [RFC3462].  While there have been previous work in this
   area([STRADS_BCP] and [ASRG_ABUSE]), none of them have yet been
   sucessful.  It is hoped that this document will have a better fate.

   This format is intended primarily as an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)
   for reporting email abuse but also includes support for direct
   feedback via end user mail clients, reports of some types of virus
   activity, and some similar issues.

   This document only defines the format and content type to be used for
   these reports.  Determination of where these reports should be sent,
   how trust among report generators and report recipients is
   established, and reports related to more than one message are outside
   the scope of this document.  It is assumed that best practices will
   evolve over time, and will be codified in future documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Intent

   The reports defined in this document are intended for several
   purposes:

   o  To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from or related to
      their networks

   o  To inform email service providers or other primarily outbound
      senders that there may be issues regarding their mail.  These
      issues include (but are not limited to) reports that the mail may
      be considered to be "spam" by a recipient of the message.

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


   o  To inform email service provides about opt-out requests

   o  To advise providers that certify or otherwise make assertions
      about mail of recipient disagreement with the assertions.

   Please note that while the parent "multipart/report" content type
   defined in RFC 3462 is used for all kinds of administrative messages,
   this format is intended specifically for communications among
   providers regarding email abuse and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be
   used for other reports.


3.  Requirements

   The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports (the
   actual standard is defined in the next sections) :

   o  They must be both human and machine readable

   o  A copy of the original email message (body and headers) or the
      message headers must be enclosed in order to allow the receiver to
      properly handle the report.

   o  The machine readable section must provide ability for the report
      generators to share metadata with receivers,

   o  The format must be extensible.


4.  Format of Email Feedback Reports

   To satisfy the requirements, an email feedback report is defined as a
   MIME message with a top level MIME content type of "multipart/report"
   (as defined in RFC 3462).  The following apply:

   a.  The "report-type" parameter of "multipart/report" type is set to
       "feedback-report"

   b.  The first MIME part of the message contains a human readable
       description of the report and MUST be included.

   c.  The second MIME part of the message is a machine-readable section
       with the content type of "message/feedback-report" (defined later
       on in this document) and MUST be included.  This section is
       intended to convey metadata about the report in question that may
       not be readily available from the included email message itself.

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


   d.  The third MIME part of the message contains either a full copy of
       the original message with a MIME content type of "message/rfc822"
       (as defined in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) OR a copy of the headers from
       the original message with MIME content type of "text/
       rfc822-headers" (as defined in RFC 3462).  This part MUST be
       included (unlike RFC 3462).  While some operators may choose to
       modify or redact this portion for privacy or legal reasons, it is
       RECOMMENDED that the entire original email message be included
       without any modification.

   e.  Each feedback report MUST be related to only a SINGLE email
       message.  Summary and aggregate formats are outside the scope of
       this specification.

   f.  The subject line of the feedback report SHOULD be the same as the
       included email message and MAY include only the standard
       forwarding prefix used by MUAs such as "FW:".  (Many smaller
       operators using MUAs for abuse handling rely on the subject lines
       for processing.)


5.  Format of 'message/feedback-report' Content Type

   This content type provides a machine-readable section intended to let
   the report generator convey metadata to the report receiver.  The
   intent of this section is to convey information which may not be
   obvious or may not be easily extracted from the original email
   message or headers.

   The body of this content type consists of multiple "fields" formatted
   according to the ABNF of RFC 822 [RFC0822] header "fields".  This
   section defines the initial set of fields provided by this
   specification.  Additional fields may be registered according to the
   procedure described later on in this document.  Altough these fields
   have a syntax similar to those of mail message headers, they are
   semantically distinct; hence they SHOULD NOT be repeated in the
   header area of the message containing the report.  Note that these
   fields represent information that the receiver is asserting about the
   report in question, but are not necessarily verifiable.  Report
   receivers MUST NOT assume that these assertions are always accurate.

5.1.  Required Fields

   The following header fields are REQUIRED and MUST only appear once:

   o  "Feedback-Type:" - contains the type of feedback report (as
      defined in the corresponding IANA registry).  This is intended to
      let report generators distinguish among different types of



Shafranovich, et al.    Expires November 29, 2007               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


      reports.

   o  "User-Agent:" - indicates the name and version of the software
      program that generated the report.  The format of this field MUST
      follow section 14.43 of RFC 2616 [RFC2616].  This field is for
      documentation only; there is no registry of user agent names or
      versions, and report receivers SHOULD NOT expect user agent names
      to belong to a known set.

   o  "Version" - indicates the version of specification that the report
      generator is using to generate the report.  The version number in
      this specification is set to "0.1".

5.2.  Optional Fields Appearing Once

   The following header fields are OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear more
   than once:

   o  "Original-Mail-From:" - copy of the email address used in the MAIL
      FROM portion of the original SMTP transaction.  The format of this
      field is defined in section 4.1.1.2 of RFC 2821 [RFC2821].

   o  "Original-Rcpt-To:" - copy of the email address used in the RCPT
      TO portion of the original SMTP transaction.  The format of this
      field is defined in section 4.1.1.3 of RFC 2821.

   o  "Received-Date:" - indicates the date the original message was
      received by recipient system's MTA.  This field MUST BE formatted
      as per section 3.3 of RFC 2822 [RFC2822].

   o  "Source-IP:" - contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from
      which the original message was received.  IPv4 addresses are to be
      formatted in dot-decimal notation as currently used by the
      community.  IPv6 addresses MUST BE formatted as per section 2.2 of
      RFC 2373 [RFC2373].

5.3.  Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times

   The following set of header fields are OPTIONAL and MAY appear more
   than once:

   o  "Authentication-Results:" - indicates the result of an
      authentication check run by the report generator.  The format of
      this field is is defined in draft-kucherawy-sender-auth-header
      [AUTH-HEADER].  Report receivers should note that this field only
      indicates an assertion made by the report generator.

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


   o  "Reported-Domain:" - indicates a domain name that the report
      generator believes to be relevant to the report.  Domain format is
      defined in section 2.3.1 of RFC 1035 [RFC1035].

   o  "Reported-URI:" - indicates a URI that the report generator
      believes to be relevant to the report.  URI format is defined in
      RFC 2396 [RFC2396].

   o  "Removal-Recipient:" - indicates the email address to be removed
      from the mailing list (MUST only be used with "opt-out" and "opt-
      out-list" types).  The format of this field is defined in section
      3.4.1 of RFC 2822.


6.  MIME Type Registration of message/feedback-report

   This section provides the media type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [RFC2048].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media types message/feedback-report

   MIME media type name: message

   MIME subtype name: feedback-report

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:

      "7bit" encoding is sufficient and MUST be used to maintain
      readability when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.

   Security considerations:

      See the "Security Considerations" of this document.

   Interoperability considerations: implementors MUST ignore any fields
   they do not support

7.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via two IANA
   registries: one for feedback types and a second for header fields.
   The feedback type registry is to be used in conjunction with the
   "Feedback-Type" field above.  The header name registry is intended
   for registration of new metadata fields to be used in the machine
   readable portion (part 2) of this format.  Please note that version
   numbers do not change with new field registrations unless a new
   specification of this format is published.  Also note that all new
   field registrations can only registered as OPTIONAL fields.  Any new
   required fields REQUIRE a new version of this specification to be
   published.

   In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability of this
   format, implementors MUST ignore any fields they do not support.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register MIME type "message/feedback-report"
   using the application provided in this document and setup two
   registries: one for header field names and a second for "Feedback-
   Type" values.  This section contains the templates used for
   registration of new entries in these registries and initial values.
   New registrations to these two registries MUST have approval by a
   Designated Expert in accordance with the Expert Review guidelines as
   described in RFC 2434 [RFC2434] (the expert should be appointed by
   the Area Directors of the Applications Area).  Any new field

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports              May 2007


   registered is considered OPTIONAL unless a new version of this
   specification is published.

   For the header name registry, the following MUST be provided in order
   to register a new header field name:

   1.  Name of the field being registered

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  Which "Feedback-Type" types does this field apply to (or "any")

   5.  The RFC number (or Internet draft name) in which this header is
       registered

   If the header field being registered requires its own IANA registry,
   than the appropriate registry MUST be properly defined.

   For the feedback type registry, the following MUST be provided in
   order to register a new header field name:

   1.  Name of the feedback type being registered

   2.  Short description

   3.  The RFC number (or Internet draft name) in which this feedback
       type is registered

8.1.  Initial Values for the Header Names Registry

   The data below are populated from this document.  The RFC number used
   for registration of these values is this document.

      provider.

   o  opt-out-list - a request to opt out from THIS mailing list ONLY.

   o  virus - report of a virus found in the originating message

   o  other - any other feedback that doesn't fit into other types.


9.  Security Considerations

   All of the Security Considerations from RFC 3462 are inherited here.

   This specification describes a report format.  This document does not
   say what a recipient of such a report must, should, or even may do
   with any report in the format described here.

      whether this format should be used for opt-outs at all.
