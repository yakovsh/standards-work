Abstract

   This document defines an extensible format and MIME type that may be
   used by network operators to report feedback about received email to
   other parties.  This format is intended as a machine readable
   replacement for various existing report formats currently used in
   Internet email.

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports            March 2005


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem has grown in the past few years, network
   operators have begun to exchange abuse reports among themselves and
   other parties to combat this problem.  However, different operators
   define their own formats and the receivers are forced to write custom
   software to interpret the many types of them.  In addition, many
   operators use various other report formats to provide non-abuse
   feedback about processed email.  This memo seeks to define a standard
   extensible format and the "message/feedback-report" MIME type for
   these reports in accordance with RFC 2048 [4].  This format and
   content type is intended to be used within the scope of the framework
   of the "multipart/report" content type defined in RFC 3462 [1].

   This document only defines the format and content type to be used for
   these reports.  Determination of where these reports should be sent
   is outside the scope of this document.

   NOTE: This document may be incomplete and is intented to evolve based
   on public discussion and feedback

2.  Intent

   The reports defined in this document are intended for several
   purposes:

   a.  To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from their networks

   b.  To provide feedback to email service providers about abuse
       complaints

   c.  To inform the author of the message that the receiver wants to
       opt out.

   Note that the reports defined in this document are limited to
   providing feedback about email only.

3.  Requirements

   The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports :

   a.  They must be both human and machine readable

   b.  Copy of the original email message or email headers must be
       enclosed in order to allow the receiver to properly handle the
       report.

4.  Format of Email Feedback Reports

   An email feedback report is a MIME message with a top level MIME
   content type of "multipart/report" (as defined in RFC 3462 [1]).  The
   following apply:

   a.  The "report-type" parameter of "multipart/report" type is set to
       "feedback-report".

   b.  The first MIME part of the message contains a human readable
       description of the report

   c.  The second MIME part of the message contains a machine readable
       abuse report with the content type of "message/feedback-report"
       (defined later on in this document).

   d.  The third MIME part of the message contains either a full copy of
       the original message with a MIME content type of "message/rfc822"
       (as defined in RFC 2046 [1]) OR a copy of the headers from the
       original message with MIME content type of "text/rfc822-headers"
       (as defined in RFC 3462 [1]).

   e.  Each abuse report should related to a single originating message.

   f.  The subject line of the abuse report should read as "Email
       Feedback Report for IP X.X.X.X" where "X.X.X.X" is the source IP
       of the MTA from which the original message was received.  If
       email authentication is used, the sender may substitute the text
       "for domain YYYYY.ZZZZ" where "YYYYY.ZZZZ" is the authenticated
       domain.

   g.  It is preferable that all original email headers are included
       even though they are defined as optional in RFC 3462 [1].


5.  Format of 'message/feedback-report' Content Type

   The message/feedback-report content type consists of several header
   fields as follows:

   a.  "Source-IP:" - contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from
       which the original message was received.

   b.  "Received-Date:" - date the original message was received.  This
       field is formatted in according to the definition in section 3.3
       of RFC 2822 [2]

Internet-Draft         Format for Feedback Reports            March 2005


   c.  "Original-Message-ID:" - contains the RFC 2822 [2] Message-ID of
       the original message

   d.  "Feedback-Type:" - contains the type of feedback as defined in
       the corresponding IANA registry.

   e.  "Authenticated-Domain:" and "Authenticated-Domain-Method:" -
       defines the authenticated domain and method used for perform that
       authentication.  The list of method tokens is contained in the
       corresponding IANA registry.  Note that the actual type of
       authentication used is outside the scope of this document.


6.  MIME Type Registration of message/feedback-report

   This section provides the media type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [4], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media types message/feedback-report

   MIME media type name: message

   MIME subtype name: feedback-report

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:

      "7bit" encoding is sufficient and MUST be used to maintain
      readability when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.

   Security considerations:

      See section 3 of RFC 3462 [1]

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: this document

   Applications which use this media type: Abuse helpdesk software for
   ISPs

7.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register MIME type "message/
   feedback-report" using the application provided in this document and
   setup two registries for "Feedback-Type" and "Authentication-Domain-
   Method" headers.  Below are the initial values for these registries.

   Initial values for the "Feedback-Type" registry:

      abuse - spam or some other kind of email abuse

      opt-out - a request to opt out from a mailing list.

      virus - report of a virus found in the originating message

   Initial values for the "Authentication-Domain-Method" registry:

      domainkeys - as defined in delany-domainkeys-base [5]

      iim - as defined in fenton-identified-mail [6]

      sender-id - as defined in lyon-senderid-core [7]

      spf - as defined in schlitt-spf-classic [8]


8.  Security Considerations

   See section 3 of RFC 3462 [1]
