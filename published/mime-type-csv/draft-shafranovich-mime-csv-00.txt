Internet-Draft           MIME Type for CSV Files           February 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this file is very common it has never
   been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registraton for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format, many of which vary from system to system.  This document
   seeks to formally register two MIME types for CSV in accordance with
   RFC 2048 [4].

2.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv and text/comma-separated-values

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [4], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media types text/csv and
   text/comma-separated-values

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv, comma-separated-values

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used.

   Encoding considerations:

      While section 4.1.1.  of RFC 2046 [1] stipulates that "text"
      subtypes MUST use a CRLF sequence as a line break, in practice
      that is not always true for CSV.  Therefore, implementors should
      be aware that either CR or CRLF maybe used as a line break for
      this format.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary

      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      maybe shared via this format which of course applies to any text
      data.

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations as described in
      appendix A.  The most common difference among various format is
      whether double quotes (") are used to enclose strings.
      Implementors should "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in
      what you accept from others" (RFC 793 [2]) when processing CSV
      files.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  A sampling of formats and discussion of differences is
      included in appendix A.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller: IESG

3.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register these two types
   "text/csv" and "text/comma-separated-values" using the application
   provided in this document.

Appendix A.  Appendix A - Discussion of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex.  [5], [6], [7] and [8]), no formal specification
   exists.  This causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   While this document does not seek to document the CSV format,
   nevertheless we want to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (either CR or CR/LF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending
       linebreak.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and will usually contain the same number of fields as the records
       in the rest of the file.  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, delimited by commas.  The last field in the record may or
       may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes, however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CR or CR/LF) and commas should be
       enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF



Shafranovich             Expires August 6, 2005                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           MIME Type for CSV Files           February 2005


       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then double-quotes
       inside fields must be surounded by double quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b"""bb","ccc"

   8.  Whitespace immediately before and after commas maybe removed
       unless it appears inside double-quotes.  For example:

       zzz,   yyy   ,   xxx

       would be processed as if it was:

       zzz,yyy,xxx

   The ABNF grammar [3] appears as follows:

      COMMA = %x2C

      file = [header] *record

      end-of-field = COMMA / (CR / CRLF)

      header = *(*WSP field *WSP end-of-field)

      record = *(*WSP field *WSP end-of-field)

      field = escaped / non-escaped

      escaped = DQUOTE *(VCHAR / CR / CRLF / 3*DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *VCHAR
